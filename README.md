# Component Extravaganza

Let's build some components to put those newly formed React skills to the test!

## Submission

This is a hybrid HW and lab. The first two assignments are to be done during lab blocks. The korilla assignment is a 2-night homework. Doing the exercises in order is strongly recommended. Fork and clone each repository. Also in the submission, please include your overall *comfort* and *completion* as well as any questions or specific areas designated for feedback.

## Components

### [Password Validator](https://git.generalassemb.ly/dc-wdi-react-redux/react-password-validator)
> Deployed App: http://excellent-tail.surge.sh/

> Read This First: https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html

Build a Sign Up Form component that:

  - Prompts the user to enter their **email**, **password** and **password confirmation**
  - When the user submits the form:
    - Notify the user of whether or not their submission was valid

### [Stopwatch](https://git.generalassemb.ly/dc-wdi-react-redux/react-stopwatch)
> Deployed App: http://scary-religion.surge.sh/

Build a Stopwatch component that:

- Allows the user to press a button "Start" to start the stopwatch
  - While the stopwatch is started, the incrementing time should be displayed
- Allows the user to press a button "Pause" to pause the stopwatch at the current time
  - Re-clicking the "Pause" button should resume the stopwatch
- Allows the user to press a button "Reset" to stop the stopwatch and reset the time to `0`

### [Korilla Receipts](https://git.generalassemb.ly/dc-wdi-react-redux/korilla-receipts)

Walk through building an interactive receipt manager.

- Start by building individual components and hard-coding the state values
- Convert the state to an array
- Render only the components that are paid
- Build a search form that live-updates the visible receipts


## Tips / Resources

- Plan first!
  - Sketch a quick wireframe of what your component will look like
  - Make a mental list of all necessary data attributes to be tracked by your component
  - Think of the types of user actions and how each action changes the component
